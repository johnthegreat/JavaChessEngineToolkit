# Java Chess Engine Toolkit

## What it is

A collection of Java classes and utilities to:
    
   * Programmatically allow chess engines that implement the Universal Chess Interface (UCI) protocol to play against each other.
   * Support the bulk collection of games / move data / etc for research, analysis, content creation, etc.
   * Provide a "quick start" for building a chess engine (A few simple examples of a weak chess engine implementation, which use psuedo-random move evaluation, are provided).
   
This project is designed to be used as a starting point for developers in other projects; not a pre-built, ready-to-use linkable library.

## Notes

  * Utilizes the Chesspresso project (LPGL 2.0)
  * Initially created with JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA and Java 8 on Windows 10.
